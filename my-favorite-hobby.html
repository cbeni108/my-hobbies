                Welcome. My name is Cristian and here are a few things to know about me.
                I have always been interested in computers and software development as a hobby, but I only recently made
                the decision to pursue it as a career. Previously, I spent several years studying veterinary medicine because I love animals.
                Several years in the field taught me that the emotional toll of working in an animal clinic is just not a fit for me.
                Now, I'm looking to apply both my soft skills and analytical aptitude to software engineering. You'd be surprised how similar anatomical systems and operating systems can be.
                Given this recent professional shift, I have begun studying computer science at Lewis University.
                Already, I have enjoyed learning about the theories and technical intricacies behind computer software.
                I look forward to exploring more into programming languages and their unique data structures, cyber security, and cloud management services.
                I'm excited to begin this journey and I hope we'll work together. I'm a hard worker with a positive attitude,
                keen attention to detail, and a penchant for knowledge, and I can't wait to make your acquaintance.
                My current obsession include a list of gaming, comic books, anime, sci-fi shows, and tons of geeky stuff including programming.
                I am designing this site to show you guys a bit about myself, so enjoy!!</span>
